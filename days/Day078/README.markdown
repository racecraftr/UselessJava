## Day 78: The bad typist
Types badly, but in a more realistic way. :)  
On the keyboard below, there are up to 4 typable keys surrounding every other key. 
Every so often, the bad typist will type on one of the 4 other keys.
(Spaces, however, will always be typed correctly - you really can't mess up spaces.)
