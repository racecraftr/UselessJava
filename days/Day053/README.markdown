## Day 53: Word generator
Generates a random word by using the `CVC` (consonant-vowel-consonant) formula.

Examples:
```text
surliccuk
sarpolmuc
fabnilkajcitlun
kacdumzez
hidzun
lup
kefjuhdivzuh
mongot
```
None of these words are "words," so to speak, but they are much more pronouncable than
```text
sdjfoiwjheo igjsoacoisacgmirwhgoicmwrh
```
