## Day 52: Minimum uno cards
So, we actually read the rules of _UNO_. Crazy, right?   
Turns out, you need **500 points** to win the game.   
To get points, you have to win rounds of _UNO_. **The points are determined by the cards that the other players have left at the end of each round.** Here is the scoring system:
```text
50 points: +4s, wilds
20 points: +2s, reverses, skips

Numbered cards give [Number on card] points.
```
This program finds the *least* possible number of cards to get that amount of points in _UNO_.
