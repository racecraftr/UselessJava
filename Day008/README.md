### What counts as a stroke?
A stroke is the basic building block for a letter. There are 4 kinds of strokes:


Straight lines (Linke M, N, F, H, A, E)

  
Doughnuts, which are circles (like O, 0,n ad o)
  
  
Humps and bumps (like u and n)
  
  
Tails (like j)
### What counts as a hole? 
A hole occurs when there is a doughnut present or when a line closes the open end of a hump/bump. 
### What counts as a dot? 
A dot is when the writing instrument is stamped to create a small mark. 


The period (.) would be one dot, the colon (:) would be two dots, but the comma (,) would be zero dots, as commas are more of a stroke then they are a dot.
