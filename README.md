## Why Java?
Java is the only programming language that I have a lot of experience with. And by a lot I mean 4 years along side my trusty Chrome browser. 

## *I see you have some Kotlin scripts*
I sure do! You can actually run them in the browser by Copy and Pasting the code into **[this website](https://play.kotlinlang.org/)**
